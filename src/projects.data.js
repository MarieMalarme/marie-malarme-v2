    This ambitious initiative aims to spread digital science through a contemporary method of learning, which revolutionizes the conventional descendant ways of aquiring knowledge ; schools all around the globe but no teachers, only students sharing and bringing their own experience to help each other and build common intelligence.
    The heart of the project is the software deployed in the schools, which consists in a platform the student uses during his whole training in 01: a complete program filled with pedagogic contents that will lead him to learn programming concepts, develop projects, review his pairs' code and work in team.
    
    Within our team of 9 developers, I'm in charge of conceiveing and designing the interface, as well as developing a consequent part of the front-end. To achieve this, I've built an entire components library, enabling my colleagues to easily integrate the design system in their work.`,
